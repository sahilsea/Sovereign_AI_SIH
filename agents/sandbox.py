"""Deterministic, isolated Python code execution sandbox.

NON-NEGOTIABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (same discipline as harness/verify.py):
1. Zero model calls in this module. The model proposes code; THIS module
   disposes of it by actually running it and reporting exactly what happened.
2. Model-proposed code never runs in the SEVERANCE server process. Two modes:
   * Container isolation (Docker deployment): when SANDBOX_SOCKET is set,
     code is sent to the separate `sandbox` container (sandbox/server.py).
     That container has no network interface, a read-only root filesystem,
     a non-root user, no Linux capabilities, pid/memory/CPU caps, and no
     access to the corpus, database, or secrets. See docker-compose.yml.
   * Process isolation (local development): when SANDBOX_SOCKET is unset,
     code runs in a fresh subprocess with a stripped environment, timeout,
     and (POSIX-only) memory limits. This does NOT block network or host
     file access.
3. Never trust the child's own claims -- stdout/stderr/exit_code come from
   the OS, not from the code's self-reported output.
4. Fails closed: if SANDBOX_SOCKET is set but the sandbox is unreachable,
   the result is a failure. It never silently falls back to local execution,
   which would quietly drop the container isolation guarantee.
