"""Scanned inspection report -> approval note pipeline.

This is the PS's named example agentic task: "reading a scanned inspection
report, pulling out key findings, and drafting an approval note as a Word
file." It reuses the SAME provenance discipline as run_ephemeral_query in
harness/runner.py, split into two channels that are NEVER blended with
equal confidence:

1. Text-layer pages (ingest/ephemeral.py's per-page PDF split): findings
   here go through the identical drafting + harness/verify.py
   citation-verification loop as everything else in this system. A
   "verified finding" in the resulting ApprovalNote is a real Citation --
   an exact verbatim substring of the source page, machine-checked.
2. Scanned/no-text-layer pages: described by the vision model. These are
   NEVER citation-verified (there is no substring to check an image
   against) and are surfaced as `visual_observations`, kept visibly
   separate in both the ApprovalNote object and the rendered Word document
   (deliver/approval_note.py).

Like ephemeral uploads in general, this is the caller's OWN document, not
governed corpus content -- no two-axis clearance gate applies (see
ingest/ephemeral.py's module docstring for the same reasoning).
