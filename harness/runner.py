"""Bounded verification loop and execution harness.

NON-NEGOTIABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
1. The retry loop is a plain Python for loop whose exit condition is
   deterministic verification.
2. Abstention: If nothing readable matched, DO NOT CALL THE MODEL AT ALL.
   A model with no sources writes fluent hallucinations.
3. Citation verification is pure Python string matching:
   - Check structured output schema.
   - Exact verbatim substring in claimed doc_id and page.
   - If verification fails, retry with the specific failure fed back into the prompt.
4. After hard cap (max_retries), ABSTAIN. Never return an unverified answer.
5. Classification inheritance: An answer inherits the highest tier and union of
   all compartments of EVERY passage placed into the prompt (not just cited ones).
6. Every query outcome (answered or abstained) writes to the hash-chained ledger.
